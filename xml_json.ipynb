    "The most difficult aspect of parsing this particular xml file was that there were two Title nodes that had values of different parent nodes. Hence in order to parse Title as required a specific pattern had to be found. Parsing the xml file as it is for the Title nodes seemed very difficult as with all the white space characters using regez it was difficult to find a specific pattern. Inorder to rectify this it seemed to make sense to flatten the data and remove all unnecessary white space characters. With the list of all the required objects/nodes of the xml file it was much easier to find a pattern and to collect all the required nodes. The second most difficult aspect of parsing the xml file was collecting multiple Titles and Relationships within the Related Term nodes, this too needed to e rectified by looking for a specific pattern."
